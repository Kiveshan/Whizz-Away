-- Migration: snapshot a subcontractor statement at the moment it is exported.
--
-- Why: subcontractor_statements is a materialised view in all but name -- the
-- generator recomputes every amount from the CURRENT legs_m2.driverrate on each
-- run (see the comment in utils/subcontractorStatementGeneration.js), so a
-- statement silently changes whenever a leg is corrected. That is fine for a
-- working figure and useless as a record of what was actually handed to a
-- subcontractor.
--
-- This table records the other half: the frozen content of a statement at the
-- instant someone printed or exported it, plus the rendered document itself in
-- S3. Rows here are immutable history and are never regenerated.
--
-- Division of responsibility:
--   audit_log  -> WHO exported, WHEN, from where (one row per export action)
--   this table -> WHAT the document said (one row per distinct content version)
-- The two join on content_hash, which the audit row carries in its metadata.
-- The snapshot payload deliberately does NOT live in audit_log.metadata: the
-- audit middleware clips arrays at 20 entries and truncates at 8000 chars, so a
-- busy subbie's leg list would be silently cut in half.
