-- Migration: index the remaining unindexed foreign-key join columns, and
-- validate the one FK that was added NOT VALID.
--
-- Why: Postgres does not index the referencing side of a FK automatically.
-- Every join from a parent to these children, and every ON DELETE check against
-- them, is a sequential scan. Measured locally (pg_stat_user_tables):
-- container had 32,517 seq scans and 0 index scans across ~11k rows, i.e. every
-- instruction/invoice lookup read the whole table.
--
-- Overlap with 007: the first five indexes below are the ones 007 creates, under
-- the same names. They are repeated (IF NOT EXISTS) because 007 was found not to
-- have been applied to every environment; on a database that has 007 they are
-- no-ops. 007's CASCADE -> RESTRICT changes are NOT repeated here; apply 007
-- itself where it is missing.
--
-- Not indexed on purpose:
--   legs_m2.m1key        leading column of legs_m2_unique_assignment_idx
--   wages.employeeid     leading column of unique_wage_per_employee_month_year
--   lookup-table FKs     (roles, shipment, expense_types, suppliers): a handful
--                        of rows each; deletes from them are rare admin actions
--   documents.client     only checked when a client is deleted (rare admin action)
--   m5_driver_rate.driverid, wages.employerid
--                        always NULL; candidates for removal, not indexing
--   statements / aging_analysis
--                        retired tables, history only
--
-- Plain CREATE INDEX (not CONCURRENTLY) inside a transaction, as in 007: the
-- largest table here is ~17k rows, so the write lock is held for milliseconds.
