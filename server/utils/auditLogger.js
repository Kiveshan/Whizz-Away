/**
 * Audit logging utility for tracking important actions.
 *
 * Two ways in:
 *  1. Automatically — middleware/auditTrail.js records every state-changing
 *     request (and the sensitive reads registered in config/auditActions.js).
 *  2. Explicitly — auditFromReq() inside a controller, when a business-level
 *     description ("Payment of R1 200 allocated to invoice 42") is worth more
 *     than the generic request-level one. An explicit call marks the request so
 *     the middleware does not write a second row for it.
 *
 * Requires migration 010_audit_log_full_coverage.sql.
